The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a language for describing multi—
participant interactive simulations —— virtual worlds networked via the
hyperlinked with the World Wide Web. All aspects of virtual world-

   
   
       

interactive behavior. These worlds can contain objec

This abstraction provided an ”addressing" scheme, a unique identifier (the Universal
Resource Locator), which could tell anyone ”where to go and how to get there” for any
piece of data within the Web. While useful, it lacked dimensionality; there’s no there
there within the web, and the only type of navigation permissible (other than surfing) is
by direct reference. In other words, I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forum
home page by saying, ”http://www.wired.com/”, which is not human—centered data. In
