provides a retrieval mechanism to complement the existing storage mechanism, it leaves
a lot to be desired, particularly for human beings.

Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners—Lee and Dave Raggett organized a

veral BOF attendees described projects already underway to build three

agreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scene
description and WWW hyperlinks —— an analog of HTML for Virtual reality. The term
Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) was coined, and the group resolved to begin
specification work after the conference. The word ’Markup’ was later changed to
’Modeling’ to reﬂect the graphical nature of VRML.
